# Changelog

All notable changes to HostLoom are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Package versions
are derived from release tags at publish time.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `HostLoom.Analyzers`, an opt-in Roslyn analyzer package that reports omitted available
  cancellation tokens on HostLoom async calls (`HLM0001`), synchronous blocking over HostLoom
  `Task` and `ValueTask` operations (`HLM0002`), and singleton dependency-injection registration
  of request handlers, event handlers, or request behaviors (`HLM0003`).
- Logging pipeline health metrics on the `HostLoom.Logging` meter: dropped records with reasons,
  queue depth, blocked enqueues and their duration, component failures, and writer state.
- A bounded logging shutdown deadline (`ShutdownTimeout`, default 5 seconds) and an optional
  bound on blocking enqueues (`EnqueueTimeout`), both counted rather than silent when they expire.
- A configurable `TimeProvider` for log timestamps, read per event on the calling thread.
- A deterministic field-name collision policy: duplicate names collapse by source precedence
  (event holes over scopes over enrichers over static fields, last occurrence wins within a
  source), user names beginning with `@` are escaped CLEF-style to `@@`, names a formatter
  reserves for its own schema are dropped rather than duplicated, and configurable name-length
  and per-record field caps apply — every dropped field counted in
  `hostloom.logging.fields.dropped`.

### Changed

- Structured log fields keep their JSON value kinds: numeric and boolean interpolation holes are
  emitted as JSON numbers and booleans, a formatted hole keeps its rendering in the message while
  the field stays typed, and `DateTimeOffset` holes default to ISO-8601.
- `ILogSink.Write` now receives a `CancellationToken` so shutdown can abandon a stalled sink.
- An unexpected formatter or sink failure faults the logging pipeline instead of silently killing
  the writer: queued and later records are counted as dropped, and no caller can block on a dead
  writer.
- Log timestamps follow operating-system clock corrections instead of drifting from a Stopwatch
  anchor captured at startup.

### Fixed

- A stray `OperationCanceledException` from a formatter or sink faults the logging pipeline
  instead of silently stopping the writer while producers still see it as running.
- Sink disposal is bounded by the logging shutdown timeout, so a sink that hangs inside its own
  flush-on-dispose cannot hang application shutdown.
- The logging writer runs on a dedicated background thread, so a stalled synchronous sink write
  no longer occupies a thread-pool worker.
- Records formatted but not yet accepted by the sink are counted when the pipeline faults or
  shutdown abandons the writer.
- Logging options are validated at provider construction: queue capacity, batch size, queue-full
  policy, time provider, and both timeouts fail fast with actionable errors.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- A transport-neutral request/response runtime with typed contracts, behaviors, scoped handlers,
  correlation, remote faults, JSON wire envelopes, host lifecycle integration, diagnostics, health
  checks, and an execution-free pipeline probe.
- Typed event publishing and named subscriptions, with fan-out semantics implemented by the
  in-memory, RabbitMQ, and Kafka transports.
- A composable asynchronous pipeline package with conditional branches, retry, circuit breaking,
  rate and concurrency limits, cooperative timeouts, short-circuits, immutable probes, metrics,
  and tracing.
- Dependency-injection pipeline registration with named stages, private transient filter
  registrations, per-run scopes and feature toggles, startup validation, topology reporting, and
  per-filter instrumentation.
- Deterministic pipeline testing helpers and harnesses, including asynchronous validation and
  disposal support, plus a runnable document-indexing example.
- An authenticated raw WebSocket RPC and live-subscription gateway with JSON, MessagePack, and
  Protocol Buffers subprotocols, bounded per-connection memory, and explicit subscription credit.
- Allocation-free UTF-8 logging compatible with `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`, with bounded
  buffering, drop accounting, trace capture, and benchmarks.

### Compatibility

- Targets .NET 10 and C# 14. This is the first public release; the API is experimental and may
  change before 1.0.
- RabbitMQ and Kafka are optional transport packages. Core pipelines and the in-memory transport
  do not require an external broker.
